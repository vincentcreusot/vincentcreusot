### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Hi, my name is Vincent Creusot

I am a senior backend developer and architect, currently loving Go :golang: after being a Java addict (still believes in it though).
ðŸ”­ Platform solutions helper, Kubernetes advocate. 
Firm believer of the event driven / message driven solutions -- for an optical fiber testing company, architected and designed an open scalable service oriented monitoring solution.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning Rust and integrations with Kubernetes.

I love travelling with my family and my dog weight more than the average person ;-)
